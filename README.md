## Motivation: 

Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 58 per cent of Indiaâ€™s population. Gross Value Added by agriculture, forestry and fishing is estimated at Rs 18.55 lakh crore (US$ 265.51 billion) in FY19(PE). Hence we can definitely say Agriculture is a large industry in India.

Apart from being a huge industry, agriculture is the main source of income for about 70 crore farmers in India. It is really amazing that so many people in our country are engaged in agriculture. But what breaks our heart is the following data: 
A total of 3,32,603 farmers (2,84,008 males and 48,595 females) committed suicide between 1995 and 2018.

When searching for the primary reason for Farmer's suicides, we came across ADSI-2015 report.  What are the reasons behind these suicides? According to the ADSI-2015 report, around 19 per cent of farmers committed suicide due to crop failure due to natural calamities.

So, we decided that no farmer should ever die because of crop failure again and we came up with our project: An AI chatbot which predicts the best suitable crop based on the season, the farmer's geolocation and also keeps him updated with modern agricultural methods which ultimately allows him to yield maximum output.

## About the project:

We've developed an intelligent chatbot using IBM's Watson assistant which assists farmers in so many ways. We have named that chatbot 'Farmer's Assistant' because of it's incredible assistance to farmers. 

Farmer's Assistant can predict the best crop to sow based on multiple factors like the farmer's location, temperature, season, yield time, possible investment cost, soil fertility.

Our chatbot is very userfriendly making it easy to use by all the farmers.
Moreover, we are making sure language won't become a barrier to the farmers so we are using a language translation service allowing the farmer to interact with the chatbot in whichever language they is comfortable with.

The chatbot is capable of answering more than 50+ common farming queries in multiple languages. 

The chatbot also provides many modern farming methods which would result in a maximum yield output if followed.

One more feature we want to include is weather forecast. We want to alert the farmer of any incoming storms so he would take all the precautionary measures.

Our last feature would be providing a helpline for various emergencies. We are providing nation helpline 1800-200-6321 and also https://farmer.gov.in/ website for any queries and details.
